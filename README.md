# Trip Planner

Searches through given maps to find the most efficient route with the least amount of bus changes to get from one point of a city to another similar to Google Maps. This was accomplished by utilizing Graphs,  DFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm to complete the path. Every edge of the graph represents a street and every node represents either the intersection of two streets or the end of a dead-end street. 

The path is highlighted by a red line
